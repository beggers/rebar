# rebar

`rebar` is an agent-operated Rust regex project with a simple goal: build a bug-for-bug compatible replacement for Python's `re` module that can eventually beat CPython across compile, match, and other common `re` workflows without giving up syntax compatibility, public API behavior, parse-tree correctness, or useful diagnostics.

This repository is run autonomously, but it is meant to be legible to humans first. If you want the short version of what `rebar` is, what exists today, and how far along it is, start with the generated status block below.

<!-- REBAR:STATUS_START -->
## Current State

_This block reports the implemented slice and measurement coverage, not estimated end-state parity._

| Signal | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Phase | Phase 3 is widening a real Rust-backed subset, but the project is still early relative to the drop-in `re` target. |
| Delivery estimate | Foundation work is complete, the published slice is expanding with explicit honest gaps and catch-up tasks, and overall stdlib-parity progress is still in the early implementation stage. |
| Current milestone | Milestone 2 keeps widening a narrow but real Rust-backed compatibility frontier, with correctness publication, Rust-backed parity, and benchmark catch-up landing in lockstep for each bounded regex slice. |
| Work queue | `8` ready, `0` in progress, `160` done, `0` blocked |
| Foundation tracks | `10/10` landed (`[##################] 100%`) |

### Correctness Snapshot

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Published cases | `304` |
| Passing in published slice | `304` |
| Explicit failures | `0` |
| Honest gaps (`unimplemented`) | `0` |
| Covered manifests | `44` |
| Source | [`reports/correctness/latest.json`](reports/correctness/latest.json) |

_These correctness counts cover only the published slice. Overall delivery estimate: Foundation work is complete, the published slice is expanding with explicit honest gaps and catch-up tasks, and overall stdlib-parity progress is still in the early implementation stage._

### Benchmark Snapshot

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline | CPython 3.12.3 (module `re`, exe `/usr/bin/python3`) |
| Published workloads | `293` |
| Workloads with real `rebar` timings | `239` |
| Known-gap workloads | `54` |
| Timing path | `source-tree-shim` |
| Source | [`reports/benchmarks/latest.json`](reports/benchmarks/latest.json) |

_Full-suite benchmark publication still runs through the source-tree shim; built-native timing remains limited to [`reports/benchmarks/native_smoke.json`](reports/benchmarks/native_smoke.json)._

_README speedup rollups stay omitted while only `239` of `293` published workloads have real `rebar` timings._

### Immediate Next Steps

- Land `RBR-0153` through `RBR-0155` for nested explicit-empty-else benchmark catch-up, the deterministic correctness corpus, and nested empty-arm anchor cleanup.
- Then land `RBR-0156` through `RBR-0161` for the bounded nested empty-yes-arm slice followed by the bounded nested fully-empty slice.

### Current Risks

- The main published benchmark report still measures the source-tree shim rather than the built-native extension path.
- Local git history is diverged from `origin/main`, so the loop cannot auto-push until the remote-only `USER-ASK-4` and `USER-ASK-5` commits are reconciled.
<!-- REBAR:STATUS_END -->

## Implementation Snapshot

`rebar` now has the hard part of the operating system in place: a supervisor/worker loop, durable state, honest correctness and benchmark publication, a Rust core crate, and a CPython-facing extension boundary. The implementation itself is real but still narrow. The published slice currently reports `304` passes with `0` honest gaps across `304` cases, and that bounded frontier is still far from full stdlib `re` parity.

The practical read is simple: infrastructure is no longer the blocker, and compatibility work is progressing in small Rust-backed slices. Near-term work is now about catching the already-live nested explicit-empty-else slice up on the benchmark surface, landing the systematic correctness corpus and nested empty-arm benchmark-anchor cleanup, and then widening into bounded nested empty-yes-arm and fully-empty conditionals.

Benchmark publication is still partial by design. The generated status block above carries the current workload and known-gap totals, while the full suite still times the source-tree shim and the built-native path remains a separate six-workload smoke artifact in `reports/benchmarks/native_smoke.json`.

## What The Numbers Mean

The correctness report is a slice-health signal, not an end-state signal. `304` passes with `0` honest gaps across `304` published cases means the currently tracked frontier is fully green, but still deliberately narrow. It still does not mean the project is close to replacing stdlib `re` across the board.

The benchmark report is still a coverage-first artifact too. It already exercises a wide workload set, but 54 rows are still explicit gaps and the main published run still measures the source-tree shim rather than the fully built-native path. That is enough to guide the queue, but not enough to make broad speed claims yet.

## Operating Model

The repo runs with a supervisor/implementation split. The supervisor maintains the harness, queue, state files, and README/reporting surfaces. The implementation worker takes one bounded task at a time and moves it to `done/` or `blocked/`. Durable context lives under `ops/state/`; ephemeral execution traces live under `.rebar/runtime/`.

## Useful Commands

```bash
python3 scripts/rebar_ops.py status
python3 scripts/rebar_ops.py report
python3 scripts/rebar_ops.py render supervisor
python3 scripts/rebar_ops.py cycle --force-agent implementation
python3 scripts/rebar_ops.py cycle --force-supervisor
bash scripts/loop_forever.sh
```

## Operating Notes

- Run the forever loop from a normal shell on a writable checkout.
- Do not start a second `python3 scripts/rebar_ops.py cycle ...` run against the same checkout while `scripts/loop_forever.sh` is active.
- Avoid launching the loop from inside another sandboxed Codex session; nested sandboxes can distort child-agent behavior and cache writes.
- The supervisor is expected to change the harness, reporting, and queue when that is the pragmatic way to keep the project moving.
